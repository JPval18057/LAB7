# ISR PROJECT
CÃ³digo del laboratorio 7 que hace parpadear la luz en un color diferente cuando recibe un dato por uart

During this project, the main task was to master the interrupt capabilities of the ARM CORTEX M4 board, and integrate different modules.
The final result was a program that controled the color of an RGB led from the computer. The user had to send a letter ("r", "g","b") to toggle
the red, green and blue colors on the led. The program also controls the PWM signal in a digital IO pin of the users choice using the timer module with interrupts.
